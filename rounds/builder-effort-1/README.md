# More builder effort: fewer repairs and less input in these attempts

Descriptive run in Kogen Lab. The planner and builder ran at medium effort instead of low on the same model, GPT-6 Luna, paired on four tasks with two repetitions.
At medium effort, all 8 attempts were correct, with 10 repairs and 2.67M input tokens in total. At low effort, 6 of 8 were correct, with 22 repairs and 3.43M input tokens.
Medium used less input in 4 of 8 pairs and more in the other 4. The lower total comes mostly from the two low-effort attempts that ran to the repair stop (1.48M input between them).
Low effort solved 11 of 12 attempts on the same tasks in [an earlier repetition run](../baseline-variance-1/README.md), so part of the correctness gap here is likely chance. Medium needed fewer repairs in 5 of 8 pairs, the same in 1 and more in 2, with the largest gaps in the two stopped low-effort attempts. Eight pairs show a pattern on these tasks, not a confirmed effect.

## Question and scope

With the planner and builder on GPT-6 Luna at medium effort instead of low, are attempts as often correct while needing fewer repairs and fewer tokens? GPT-6.1 Sol at low effort reviews after every passing verification. The run used Kogen Lab, which reproduces Kogen's build loop with its own engine; its equivalence to Kogen is not measured.

- Tasks: `r70-5-elixir`, `r70-7-elixir`, `r70-5-go`, `r70-7-go`, as in [the second mechanism screen](../screen-kogen-2/README.md), with the supplied specification.
- Two repetitions per task; each task and repetition ran both effort levels back to back on one host.
- Every attempt carried the experimental stops used in the screens: at most six repairs and 100,000 output tokens.
- The hidden tests grade each attempt independently of the workflow's own checks and review.

## Results

Each cell gives the outcome, the repairs used in parentheses, and the attempt's input tokens. "Stopped" means the six-repair stop ended the attempt.

| Task, repetition | Low effort | Medium effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `r70-5-elixir` 1 | correct (3), 0.60M | correct (2), 0.37M |
| `r70-5-elixir` 2 | stopped (6), 0.48M | correct (2), 0.82M |
| `r70-7-elixir` 1 | stopped (6), 1.00M | correct (1), 0.33M |
| `r70-7-elixir` 2 | correct (1), 0.42M | correct (2), 0.44M |
| `r70-5-go` 1 | correct (1), 0.17M | correct (1), 0.20M |
| `r70-5-go` 2 | correct (3), 0.42M | correct (1), 0.20M |
| `r70-7-go` 1 | correct (2), 0.24M | correct (0), 0.08M |
| `r70-7-go` 2 | correct (0), 0.09M | correct (1), 0.23M |
| Total | 6 of 8; 22 repairs; 3.43M input, 66k output | 8 of 8; 10 repairs; 2.67M input, 54k output |

Totals are summed from unrounded values. The run recorded 16 attempts and used about 6.1M input and 120k output tokens.

## Limits

- Eight pairs on four tasks of one family; the correctness difference is two attempts.
- Reasoning tokens per request were not separated out; the token totals above are provider-reported input and output, and cost per token is the same for both arms on this model.
- The stops are experimental and not part of Kogen; two low-effort attempts ended at the repair stop and might have succeeded later.
- Results describe Kogen Lab's reproduction of Kogen's loop; equivalence with Kogen itself is not measured.
- Lab's evaluation is not an official kogen-bench grade, so the Standard records declare the official outcome as missing (see "What's missing and why").

## Required reproduction metadata

- Kogen commit: fd0cdcfb422f6edef5ec69146cdecdb3e3c1317a, as reproduced by Kogen Lab.
- Harness commit: not recorded as a public Git commit. Kogen Lab's source is not published yet; its build fingerprint is in the bundle's `manifest.json`.
- Model and effort: planner and builder `gpt-6-luna` at `low` or `medium`, as stated per configuration; reviewer `gpt-6.1-sol` at `low`.
- Task IDs: `r70-5-elixir`, `r70-7-elixir`, `r70-5-go`, `r70-7-go`.
- Command: `kogen-lab freeze`, then `kogen-lab run` on the frozen experiment, then `kogen-lab export` and Lab's `export_bench_round.py` to write these records.
- Raw records: [`records.jsonl`](records.jsonl) and the Lab export in [`bundles/`](bundles/).

## Execution record

- One experiment, frozen before its first attempt and run from a frozen Lab development build over six host slots (three work folders on one macOS workstation, two on one Ubuntu 24.04 server, one Ubuntu 24.04 laptop).
- Records: [`records.jsonl`](records.jsonl) holds one Standard 1.2 record per attempt (16). [`MISSING.md`](MISSING.md) and [`MEASURED.md`](MEASURED.md) declare what the records cannot carry.
- [`bundles/`](bundles/) holds Lab's public export; its `EXCLUDED.json` lists what was left out and why.
